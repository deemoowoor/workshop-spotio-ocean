# Create K8s

There are many ways to provision K8s clusters.

In this workshop we will use AWS managed k8s service - EKS.

On top of that we will use eksctl. Eksctl is a cli that helps with provisioning EKS clusters.
eksctl uses Cloud Formation behind the scenes.

## EKS

### Prerequisites

In order to provision and manage an EKS cluster using the terminal you'll need to install the following components:

- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)
- [eksctl](https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl)
- [aws-iam-authenticator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-aws-iam-authenticator.html)
- [kubectl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-kubectl.html)

> Note: For our example application it is important to have more than 1 worker node across multiple AZ's

Use the following command if you'd like to provision EKS with new a VPC
`eksctl create cluster --version=1.17 --name=spotio-workshop --nodes=3 --node-ami=auto --region=eu-west-1`

Use the following command if you'd like to provision EKS in an exising VPC
`eksctl create cluster --name=spotio-EKS --version=1.17 --nodes-min=3 --nodes-max=6 --tags Key=Value --tags Protected=weekend --region=${AWS_REGION} --vpc-public-subnets=subnet-XXXXX,subnet-YYYYY --vpc-private-subnets=subnet-AAAA,subnet-BBBB`

> Note:
If you would like to delete your cluster, use the following command:
`eksctl delete cluster --name=spotio-workshop`
