# Advanced Scaling Concepts

Ocean providers the k8s serverless expierence.
Ocean is built in order to mitigate between the container level to the infrastructure level, Ocean does that by allowing you to configure define the requiered infrastructure in your deployment/pod level.

---

## Support for built-in node-labels

By default, when a k8s cluster runs on top of a cloud provider there are some built-in node-labels that are being attached to each node in the cluster.

These are the built-in labels:
* kubernetes.io/hostname
* failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone
* failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region
* beta.kubernetes.io/instance-type
* kubernetes.io/os
* kubernetes.io/arch

### Lets see that in action

### Run a deployment on a specific AZ
In this example we will use the nodeSelector section in order to specify that we want our deployment to run on availability zone us-west-2c

Run the following command from your terminal:
```
kubectl apply -f ./scheduling-examples/az-c.yaml
```

### Run an application on a list of specified instance-types
In this example we will use the nodeAffinity section in order to define that our deployment can only run on one of the following instance types: c5.2xlarge, c5.4xlarge

Run the following command from your terminal:
```
kubectl apply -f ./scheduling-examples/specific-instance-type.yaml
```

### PVC Support
In the next example we will run a Deployment that has a PVC attached to it, the PVC resides in az us-west-2b.

Behind the scences Spotinst Ocean Autoscaler will recognize the location of the PVC and will make sure that the requiered resources exist in the correct az.

Run the following command from your terminal:
```
kubectl apply -f ./scheduling-examples/pvc-az-b.yaml
```

## Spotinst labels and taints 
### Run a deployment on an On Demand instance
In this example we will use Spotinst proprietary labels in order to run a specific Deployment on an On Demand instance and make sure the Autoscaler wouldn't scale it down.

We will use the nodeSelector section to specify that we want the deployment to run only on top of nodes that has the following node label: "spotinst.io/node-lifecycle: od"

Behind the scenes Spotinst Ocean will recognize that a deployment has this nodeSelector label and will launch and On Demand instance, label it in the correct way in order for the k8s scheduler to be able to schedule the pods on top of this instance/s.

On top of that, we've added the deplyment label "spotinst.io/restrict-scale-down: true" which will make sure the Autoscaler wouldn't scale down the instance running the pods from this deployment

Run the following command from your terminal:
```
kubectl apply -f ./scheduling-examples/pod-od.yaml
```
