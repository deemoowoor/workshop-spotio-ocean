# Create K8s

There are many ways to provision K8s clusters.

In this workshop will use AWS managed k8s service that is called EKS.

On top of that we will use eksctl, eksctl is a cli that helps with provisoning EKS clusters.
eksctl uses Cloud Formation behind the scenes.

## EKS

### Prerequisits

In order to provision and manage an EKS cluster using the terminal you'll need to install the following components:

- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)
- [eksctl](https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl)
- [aws-iam-authenticator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-aws-iam-authenticator.html)

> Note: For our example application it is important to have more than 1 worker node across multiple AZ's

Use the following command if you'd like to provision EKS with new VPC
`eksctl create cluster --version=1.13 --name=spotinst-workshop --nodes=3 --node-ami=auto --region=${AWS_REGION}`

Use the following command if you'd like to provision EKS in exising VPC
`eksctl create cluster --name=Webinar-EKS --version=1.12 --nodes-min=3 --nodes-max=6 --tags Key=Value --tags Protected=weekend --region=${AWS_REGION} --vpc-public-subnets=subnet-XXXXX,subnet-YYYYY --vpc-private-subnets=subnet-AAAA,subnet-BBBB`

> Note:
If you would like to delete your cluster, use the following command:
`eksctl delete cluster --name=eksworkshop-eksctl`
